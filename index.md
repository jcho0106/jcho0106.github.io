### CPSC 120

* Lab 4, part 2

    Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite because it was the first lab that felt like we had created a game. I was able to use if and else statements for the first time to guess the secret number in the guessing game.


* Lab 7, part 2

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I have taken a few basic intro computer science classes in middle and highschool and Blackjack was always shown as the example but never actually taught. It was really cool to finally learn. I was able to learn how to write functions of Blackjack hand without the number of Aces dealt mattering.



* Lab 8, part 1

    Lab 8, part 1 was a favorite because this lab felt like a food ordering system and it was interesting. I was able to write argument functions to create a fun and functioning mad libs game.
