### Favorite CPSC 120 Labs

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite because it was the first lab that felt like we had created a game. I was able to use if and else statements for the first time to guess the secret number in the guessing game.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because it was cool to code something that is able to tell you if a parking spot was available or not. I was able to learn how to use command line arguments to properly code to know if the parking spot was available or not.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was a favorite because this lab felt like a food ordering system and it was interesting. I was able to write argument functions to create a fun and functioning mad libs game.
